CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1. Introduction
In this chapter, the concepts and technologies used in the work and how they are used are explained. Computerized systems have been increasing in medical sections nowadays. Information Technology plays a very important role in Medicals. Computers have made dramatic changes in the learning system. Information technology enables medical institutions to save space and time, and allows the delivery of medical services with easiness, anywhere, and anytime.

2.2. Computerized Systems
Technology advances so fast that computers become part of our daily live. People use computers everywhere, at work, at school, and at home. The computerized systems are very efficient, process huge amount of data and keep big amount of information.
Malolos ET .al (2002) says that automated systems are important as the time and manual efforts are minimized.
Janes(2001) elaborated that computer are devices that are greatly reliable and very powerful. He said that computers possess three advantages compared to other equipment’s in the office. The computers have these three benefits in the sense that they are faster, more accurate and more economical.
Reyes (2005) stated that perform work manually is time consuming. But using computers make our task more practical.
In Flores (2002) point of view, he defined automation as the replacement of machine control of human.
According to Dioso (2001), computer helps in planning, organizing and controlling in an intelligent manner.
In Ralph M. Stair (1999) point of view, the growing of technology helps people to perform a lot of tasks with less effort.
Gurewich (1999) said that in any corporation the work is done faster when using database system. With the use of computerized system everything is done faster compared to tasks that are performed in a manual way.
Mane (2000) said that the invention of the computer made the task easier to perform than by doing it manually. The computer is very necessary for everyone and it is very good productivity machine. The data are stored in the computer and users can access the information whenever they are in need.
Bryan (2006) defined the information as a set of people, procedures and resources that collects processes and distributes information in an organization. They consist of simple manual information system and as well as computer-based information system that uses hardware, software telecommunication and other forms of information technology.
Sender (2002) referred computers as an intelligence amplifier that can free human to use their time effectively. Computers perform tasks with high speed and accuracy.
Thowsand (2005) defined database system as a structured set of data. These data can be about people, products or event.
Adamski (2007) highlighted the benefits of database by saying it is economical, a lot of information can be retrieved from some amount of data, and there is control of redundancy, integrity, security, flexibility, responsiveness, improvement of maintenance and data independence.

2.3. Web-Based Application
A web application is defined as any application that is accessed through web over a network for instance Internet or intranet. Web applications
Nijaz (2000) stated that web applications are famous from the fact that there is ability to update and maintain theses application without disturbing and installing software on millions of clients’ computers. In the same way, Bohle (2002) also elaborated the popularity of web applications because of the ubiquity of the client.
According to Nijaz (2000) and Jurca (1999) the web is world- wide and has capacity to broadcast, its s a mechanism to distribute information, a platform that allows users to collaborate, to interact regardless the geographic location. The principal reason for enhancing the Web services is to build systems that interactive, friendly and flexible to users.

2.4.  Programming languages on the World Wide Web
•	The main building technology of the application, Computer-Based Testing System is the HTML, The HTML is the mark-up language used to describe and define the content of the webpage. The HTML is issued to tell the browser what to display on the page, like the appearance of text Such as bold or italics text and also used to specify images. The main HTML features used were form and Cascading Style Sheet. The form was used to collect LOGIN data username and password from a user and a submit button (Log in)to send the collected data to a web document to act on the data.
•	The styling of the application was done using CSS. This includes the
1.	The Layout
2.	Link Styling
3.	Colouring
4.	Picture Alignment
•	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the look and formatting of the document written in HTML. The presentation of information to the user by the browser was controlled by means of Cascading Style Sheet. Cascading Style Sheet is a cornerstone specification of the web and was used in the application to describe them
presentation. CSS was designed to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colours, and fonts.
•	JavaScript is combined with HTML and CSS to create a dynamic HTML page. JavaScript is commonly used on the internet to create web pages that respond to user actions, like when user moves a mouse pointer over an image or clicks a form button. JavaScript was used for the client-side scripting and security; it was also integrated with jQuery and ajax to create Model Windows used in the application like:
i.	Generating Print preview display
ii.	To ensure the registrant does not submit empty forms
iii.	To ensure that the information requested is what the user enters using the JAVASCRIPT regular expression to match the data submitted.



CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY (WORKDONE)

3.1. Research Methodology
Main methodology activities held during the research is acquiring information and knowledge about Medical Search Engine system through reading books, and researches that were previously done in related area. All the research materials were obtained over the internet, Wikipedia and other websites.
Next step taken is reading, comprehending and analysing literature review and matching information obtained. This research emphasizes online examination system, which include usability, user-friendly interface, reliability, costing and meeting needs of target users.   
3.2. Project Activities
In order to give solution to problems in an industry, software developer or a team of developers must incorporate a development strategy that encompasses the process, methods and tools layers and generic phases. This strategy is often referred to as process model or a software developing paradigm. A process model for software developing is chosen based on the nature of project and application, the methods and tools to be used, and the controls and deliverables that are required. All software development can be characterized as a problem-solving loop in which distinct stages are encountered. Regardless of the process model that is chosen for a software project, all of the stages coexist simultaneously at some level of detail. 
The methodology chosen to develop this system is waterfall model approach. I opted for this method because I found that it is the best for my project where the stages involved can assist my level of progress. Many developers prefer waterfall model and widely use it as a development strategy.

Waterfall model approach is chosen because the approach allows the development of the system to be revised after the stages is finished. Once the stages are not satisfied, then going back to the previous stages can be considered necessary to add or modify any features. The different stages for this model: 
•	Project Planning 
•	Requirements Design 
•	Design 
•	Development 
•	Integration and Testing 
•	Installation and Acceptance

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.1. Use Case Diagram
The unified modelling language used is use case diagram. A use case is a set of scenarios that describes an interaction between a user and a system. A use case diagram displays the relationship among actors and use cases. The two main components of a use case diagram are use cases and actors. The actors in our system are students and lecturers. The use case diagram is designed in the following figure.

Figure 2: use case diagram 






4.2. System Flow Chart
System flowcharts are a way of displaying how data flows in a system and how decisions are made to control events. To illustrate this, symbols are used. They are connected together to show what happens to data and where it goes. Note that system flow charts are very similar to data flow charts.
